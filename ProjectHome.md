Human actions is an essential content of many images. Recognizing human actions from still images has many direct applications in image search, indexing, surveillance and others. Besides, actions provide constraints helping interpretation of objects, geometry, function and other useful properties of visual scenes. Previous research has mostly concentrated on action recognition in video and ignored actions in still images. While motion in video provides powerful information for action recognition, the lack of this information has to be compensated by more sophisticated (intelligent) methods when recognizing actions from a single image. In addition, some actions (e.g. photographing) are static by their nature and must be recognized from static cues alone.
